# puppet-installers

Nothing fancy, just my bash-based Puppet (and OpenVox) installer scripts.  A few flags, including turning database/PuppetDB features on and off, autosigning, waitforcert, etc.

Vagrantfile included for bringing up a server and client instance to test things out.

External Node Classifier not included but link shown.

Will have been by someone else in less lines of code and with more extensive README documentation.
